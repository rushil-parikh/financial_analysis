# Financial Analysis Dashboard

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to create a professional and insightful financial analysis dashboard using Power BI. The idea was to analyze business performance, highlight key trends, and answer important financial questions. Instead of relying on external data sources, I used the **sample dataset provided within Power BI's Windows application**, making it accessible for others to replicate and learn from.

You can download the same dataset from [Microsoft's Financial Sample Dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download).

## Key Questions (KPIs)
This project aimed to answer these critical questions:
1. **Sales Trends**: How have sales performed over time? Are there patterns in yearly or monthly sales?
2. **Orders and Profit Analysis**: Which countries and segments are contributing the most (and least) to orders and profit?
3. **Discount Trends**: What percentage of discounts was offered across different bands, and how does it impact revenue and profit?
4. **Top Performers**: Which products and segments are the best and worst performers in terms of profit margin and sales?
5. **Comparative Insights**: How do current-year metrics compare to previous-year metrics across key indicators?

## Process
The steps I followed to create this project include:

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Loaded the sample dataset into Power BI.
- Inspected and cleaned the data using the Power Query Editor, ensuring proper data types (e.g., decimals converted to whole numbers where necessary).
- Built relationships within the dataset for time intelligence calculations.

### 2. Data Modeling
- Created a date table to enable advanced time-based analysis.
- Added calculated columns and measures using DAX for KPIs like total sales, profit margin, and discounts.

### 3. Dashboard Creation
- Designed a visually engaging and interactive dashboard.
- Used bar charts, line graphs, donut charts, and KPIs to represent data clearly.
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight top-performing products and negative profit margins.

### 4. Customization
- Customized the theme and visuals for a consistent and professional look.
- Used smart color coding, font styles, and alignment to enhance readability.

## Project Insights
Here’s what I discovered:

### Sales Growth
- Total sales this year reached **92,311,095**, a **249.46% increase** compared to last year (**26,415,256**).
- Monthly sales trends revealed peak performance during mid-year months.

### Profit Trends
- Profit this year stands at **13,015,238**, up by **235.58%** from last year (**3,878,465**).
- However, some segments, like **Enterprise (-3%)**, performed poorly, reflecting potential challenges in that area.

### Order Analysis
- Total orders grew significantly to **861,132**, a **225.36% increase** from the previous year (**264,674**).
- Top-performing countries in terms of orders include **Canada (247K)** and **France (241K)**.

### Discount Impact
- The **High discount band** made up **57.8%** of the total discounts offered.
- Discounts likely drove higher sales but need closer evaluation for profitability.

### Top Products
- Products like **Paseo (33,011K)**, **VTT (20,512K)**, and **Velo (18,250K)** were the top contributors to sales.
- Their consistent performance makes them valuable assets for future inventory planning.

### Profit Margins by Segment
- **Channel Partners** led with a remarkable profit margin of **73%**, while **Midmarket** followed at **28%**.
- A deeper focus on underperforming segments like **Enterprise** can boost overall profitability.

## Final Conclusion
This project showcased how Power BI can turn raw data into meaningful insights. By analyzing key performance metrics like sales, orders, discounts, and profit, I identified both growth opportunities and challenges. The dashboard is not just a visual representation—it’s a tool for decision-making.

The **Enterprise segment** and **High discount band** need attention for improving profitability. On the other hand, products like **Paseo** and **VTT** are clear market leaders and should be prioritized in future strategies.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Handle data end-to-end (cleaning, modeling, and analysis).
- Create insightful dashboards that answer real business questions.
- Use Power BI effectively for both technical and business storytelling.

The best part? This dashboard is interactive, visually engaging, and replicable. If you're interested in diving deeper, feel free to explore the visuals or replicate the project using the dataset link above.
